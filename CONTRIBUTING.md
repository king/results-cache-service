How to contribute
=================

This project is not aimed to get contributions. It is only a reference implementation of 
a results cache server to be used by the Jenkins Jobs Results Cache Plugin.
Anyway, if you want to contribute here are a few important things you should know about 
contributing:

Contributor License Agreement
-----------------------------

Contributions to any King project must be accompanied by a Contributor
License Agreement. This is not a copyright _assignment_; it simply gives
King permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the
project.

  - If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to [sign](http://goo.gl/forms/zbRt3cUSS7LXfZYy2) an [individual
    CLA][]. Please include your GitHub username.
  - If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
    then you'll need to [sign](http://goo.gl/forms/25g4c3GacFLsR2oI2) a [corporate CLA][].

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted
one (even if it was for a different King project), you probably don't need to do it
again.
